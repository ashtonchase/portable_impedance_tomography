	abstract = {Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a noninvasive and commonly used method for the assessment of body composition including body water. We designed a small, portable and wireless multi-frequency impedance spectrometer based on the 12 bit impedance network analyzer AD5933 and a precision wide-band constant current source for tetrapolar whole body impedance measurements. The impedance spectrometer communicates via Bluetooth with mobile devices (smart phone or tablet computer) that provide user interface for patient management and data visualization. The export of patient measurement results into a clinical research database facilitates the aggregation of bioelectrical impedance analysis and biolectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) data across multiple subjects and/or studies. The performance of the spectrometer was evaluated using a passive tissue equivalent circuit model as well as a comparison of body composition changes assessed with bioelectrical impedance and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in healthy volunteers. Our results show an absolute error of 1\% for resistance and 5\% for reactance measurements in the frequency range of 3 kHz to 150 kHz. A linear regression of BIA and DXA fat mass estimations showed a strong correlation (r2=0.985) between measures with a maximum absolute error of 6.5\%. The simplicity of BIA measurements, a cost effective design and the simple visual representation of impedance data enables patients to compare and determine body composition during the time course of a specific treatment plan in a clinical or home environment.},

	doi = {10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090891},
	abstract = {Advances on System-On-Chip and Textile technology allows the development of Textile-enabled measurement instrumentation. Textile Electrodes (Textrodes) have been proven reliable for performing Electrical Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (EBIS) measurements, and the availability of a integrated circuit impedance spectrometer, the AD5933, has allowed the implementation of small size EBIS spectrometers. In this work an AD5933-based spectrometer has been implemented, and its performance on 2R1C circuits and for tetrapolar total right side EBIS measurements has been compared against the commercially available spectrometer SFB7. The study has been focused on the working upper frequency range and the estimation of the Cole parameters required for assessment of body fluid distribution: R0 and R∞. The results indicate that AD5933-based spectrometer implemented in this work can perform accurate impedance measurements well above the upper limits recommended in the datasheet. The AD5933-EBIS presents a good performance compared with the SFB7 on the 2R1C circuit and the total right side measurements, showing a smaller error in the resistance spectrum and small deviation error in the reactance when measuring over 270 kHz. The comparison on the Cole parameters estimation obtained with the SFB7 and the AD5933-based spectrometer exhibit a difference below 1\% for the estimation of R0 and R∞. Consequently the overall measurement performance shown by the implemented AD5933-based spectrometer suggests its feasible use for EBIS measurements using dry Textrodes. This is of special relevance for the proliferation of EBI-based personalized health monitoring systems for patients that require to monitor the distribution of body fluids, like in dialysis.},

Frequency range available for measuring is from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. The device is based on The Freescale Tower system module with S08MM Freescale microcontroller. The proposed device is divided into two modules. One of them includes measurement chain, the second one contains four multiplexers, which connect always four electrodes to the circuit from total amount of sixteen electrodes. Both modules are connected via Tower elevator modules. While measuring impedance the systematic error occured, so we used the Quadratic Interpolation Self-calibration algorithm for calculation of the measured impedance. Calibration was applied on the absolute value of impedance. Calibration on the phase shift has not been done yet, since both input signals to GPD are highly disturbed with the noise, although they pass through a low-pass filter with cut-off frequency of 1 MHz. The superposed noise confuses GPD, so it cannot give the correct results. The relative error of impedance measurement after calibration ranges from -4.52 \% to 5.98 \% with mean value of -0.02 \%.},

The impedance measurement studies in biomedical applications such as bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), electrical impedance plethysmography (IPG), electrical impedance myography (EIM), electrical impedance cardiography (ICG), electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), electrical impedance tomography (EIT) all need a high precision impedance measurement circuit with high signal to noise ratio (SNR). Moreover the impedance measurement circuit applied to the biomedical, clinical or medical applications such as human subject studies should have a better patient safety. In this direction a Battery-based Constant Current Source (Bb-CCS) is developed for biomedical applications. The Bb-CCS is developed with a modified Howland current source (MHCS) fed by a battery based power supply (BBPS). The current amplitude, frequency and waveforms are set as the circuit variables which are found as adjustable as per the requirements.

	abstract = {The increasing number of applications of electrical bioimpedance measurements in biomedical practice, together with continuous advances in textile technology, has encouraged several researchers to make the first attempts to develop portable, even wearable, electrical bioimpedance measurement systems. The main target of these systems is personal and home monitoring. Analog Devices has made available AD5933, a new system-on-chip fully integrated electrical impedance spectrometer, which might allow the implementation of minimum-size instrumentation for electrical bioimpedance measurements. However, AD5933 as such is not suitable for most applications of electrical bioimpedance. In this work, we present a relatively simple analog front-end that adapts AD5933 to a four-electrode strategy, allowing its use in biomedical applications for the first time. The resulting impedance measurements exhibit a very good performance in aspects like load dynamic range and accuracy. This type of minimum-size, system-on-chip-based bioimpedance measurement system would lead researchers to develop and implement light and wearable electrical bioimpedance systems for home and personal health monitoring applications, a new and huge niche for medical technology development.},

	abstract = {Multifrequency Electrical Bioimpedance (MEB) has been widely used as a non-invasive technique for characterizing tissues. Most MEB systems use wideband current sources for injecting current to load and instrumentation amplifiers for measuring the resultant potential. Current sources should present intrinsically high output impedance in a very wide frequency range. The objective of this work is to investigate the performance of the Mirrored Modified Howland Current Source (MMHCS) by comparing the analytical solution with the SPICE simulation. It was implemented four MMHCS circuits by using four different operational amplifiers each one. The output current was set to 1 mAp (peak) in the frequency from 1 Hz to 100 MHz. Both techniques presented similar results at lower frequencies. It can be concluded that the output impedance of the circuit is highly dependent of the open-loop gain of the operation amplifier. The analytical solution showed that it is possible to project a current source by using only theirs output current and impedance equations.},

	abstract = {The measurement of salt content in processed products still remains a problem to solve in the food industry due to the destructive nature of the conventional measurement methods. In this paper a method to assess salt content in food products such as cured ham or pork loin using impedance spectroscopy is presented. A low-cost system to carry out a punctual measurement of the impedance inside the food sample based on a non-destructive sensor was developed. The system includes an electronic equipment that allows the implementation of impedance spectroscopy and an electrode consisting of a coaxial needle. In order to validate the equipment, solutions with different salt concentrations were measured. The impedance modulus and phase values obtained for each frequency were processed using PLS; the results show a very good correlation between predicted and observed data. The same process was carried out on minced meat samples and again a good correlation was obtained. The PLS tool generated a model that permits prediction of salt levels in new meat samples.},

	abstract = {A method which involves the measurement of bioelectrical resistive impedance (R) for the estimation of human body composition is described. This method is based upon the principle that the electrical conductivity of the fat-free tissue mass (FFM) is far greater than that of fat. Determinations of R were made in 37 healthy men aged 28.8 +/- 7.1 yr (mean +/- SD) using an electrical impedance plethysmograph with a four electrode arrangement that introduces a painless signal (800 microA at 50 kHz) into the body. FFM was assessed by hydrodensitometry and ranged from 44.6-98.1 kg. Total body water (TBW) determined by D2O dilution and total body potassium (TBK) from whole body counting were 50.6 +/- 10.3 L and 167.5 +/- 38.1 g, respectively. Test-retest correlation coefficient was 0.99 for a single R measurement and the reliability coefficient for a single R measurement over 5 days was 0.99. Linear relationships were found between R values and FFM (r = -0.86), TBW (r = -0.86), and TBK (r = -0.79). Significant (p less than 0.01) increases in the correlation coefficients were observed when the predictor Ht2/R was regressed against FFM (r = 0.98), TBW (r = 0.95), AND TBK (r = 0.96). These data indicate that the bioelectrical impedance technique is a reliable and valid approach for the estimation of human body composition. This method is safe, noninvasive, provides rapid measurements, requires little operator skill and subject cooperation, and is portable. Further validation of this method is recommended in subjects with abnormal body composition.},
